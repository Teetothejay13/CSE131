As a note for the person grading this, I really don't want to hear any flak about test cases covering multiple aspects.
It causes no problems, and it clearly shows that both requirements are fulfilled in that particular test case. If it works,
don't diss it. I saw a way to make testing easier and more efficient, so I went for it.

Test Case 1: Invalid Column
    Inputs: Z8, 6
    Output: Invalid column message
    Type: Boundary condition, column must be limited to A through I

Test Case 2: Invalid Row
    Inputs: A0, 6
    Output: Invalid row message
    Type: Boundary condition, row must be limited to 1 through 9

Test Case 3: Reverse Coordinate and Space Already Filled
    Inputs: 1A, 5
    Outputs: No error for reverse coordinate, space already filled message
    Type: Requirement/Error State, the space cannot be edited if it is already filled; It also must be able to accept reverse coordinates.

Test Case 4: Lowercase Coordinate and Unique Row
    Inputs: b2, 2
    Outputs: No error for lowercase coordinate, row already has number message
    Type: Requirement/Error State, the space cannot be edited if the number exists in the row, and must be able to accept lowercase coordinates.

Test Case 5: Unique Column
    Inputs: B2, 7
    Output: Column already has number message
    Type: Requirement, the space cannot be edited if the number exists in the column.

Test Case 6: Number Already In Space
    Inputs: A9, 9
    Output: Number already in space message
    Type: Requirement, space cannot be edited if the number is already in the space.
